Project Gallery


This is just my project gallery isolated. 

It was made within the deployed application website and I would prefer if it was viewed and judged as part of that. 

I made this in order to have something to submit on the application form as recommended in the discord by Gregor


I made the buttons manually and added the background images in and I am happy with how they came out. Took inspiration from the buttons in my RPS game.
I originally wanted to have them on a carousel where I could click next to bring one into focus but I only had 4 projects lol so I decided to go with the  the modals instead and glad I did tbh. think they look really clean and smooth.
