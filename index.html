      <h2>My First Cooking Website</h2>
      <img src="../FACwebsiteCurrent/images.png/hobbypage1.png" alt="Cooking Website Screenshot" class="website-image" />
      <p>
        I built this website as I have recently been learning cooking. It was the first website I ever created, and it served as a great chance to learn and practice HTML and CSS. Getting started I followed the start of the curriculums from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> to acquire the necessary skills to bring my cooking hobby to life online.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the website, I felt proud of my progress and accomplishments. I had to come back quite a bit later to add JavaScript to display the  date, showcasing my new skills in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website stands as a testament to the start of my learning coding journey and dedication to web development, and its simple, fun project that I hope to come back to when I am further down the road to update.

      <h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</h2>
      <img src="../FACwebsiteCurrent/images.png/RPS.png" alt="Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Screenshot" class="game-image" />
      <p>
        For this project, I developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The initial version of the game was designed to work solely in the console, focusing on the underlying game logic. This approach allowed me to concentrate on perfecting the core gameplay mechanics before moving on to the user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the console-based game was completed, I returned to the project to design and implement a user-friendly interface. This process was challenging, as it required me to integrate the JavaScript logic with the HTML and CSS elements. Although it took me a while, I am satisfied with the final result. I believe that the game's appearance and usability could be further improved with more experience and practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make is a little more fun and interesting I swapped out Rock, Paper and Scissors for Earth, Wind and Fire and set the page up to play 'September' from the band of the same name.

      <h2>Movie Data Page</h2>
      <img src="../FACwebsiteCurrent/images.png/moviedata.png" alt="Movie Data Page Screenshot" class="game-image" />
      <p>
        For this project, I created a movie data page that allows users to rank and sort movies by year, rating, runtime, and other categories. I struggled with the implementation of the sorting algorithms quite a lot, so I ended up having to google and copy (but write out myself!) a decent chunk of it. I got an okay understating of how to create interactive features for users to interact with but this was my least confident project on the application.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Although I relied googling almost all of the sorting system, I view this as a valuable learning experience- the fact that I finished the project even though I do feel like I did not understand what I was doing when starting out it shows that things are possible if you think about them in a problem solving way and are not afraid to google and borrow from solutions when stuck. With more practice and experience, hopefully believe that I will be able to create similar projects without needing to rely on help so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left this project until last, I didn't realise it would be so difficult for me as I had not read that we needed a way for users to inteact with and add to the data set. In summary I was pretty dissapointed in myself for this project, but I suppose I am satisfied with how it came out.
